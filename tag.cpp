Hi sir Canaria here's the tag i use to create this performance task

#include <iostream>: Includes the input-output stream for handling standard input and output.

#include <iomanip>: Includes functions for manipulating the output format, such as setw() and setfill().

#include <string>: Includes the string class to handle text strings.


Key C++ functions and formatting techniques used:

setfill('='): Fills empty spaces in output with a chosen character (e.g., =).

setw(50): Sets the width of the output field to 50 characters.

left and right: Aligns the output to the left or right within the specified width.

cout << endl: Outputs a newline to the console.

fixed and setprecision(): Can be added to ensure precise formatting for floating-point numbers (if needed for grades).


These tools help to structure the report card and apply a visual design with separators (= and -), as requested.
