It is really amazing to learn Turbo C++, especially if studied in a historical context and the influence placed on the development of programming languages. 
As student, while mastering Turbo C++, learns how older compilers work and acquaints him/her with the grounding aspects of C++ programming. 
It helps develop the basic syntax, control structures, and principles of object-oriented programming into more modern environments.

Reflecting on the process, it's clear that Turbo C++ is not a popular choice today with its outdated features as most modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). 
Still, working with it teaches the value of minimalism and efficiency and the importance of memory management, often abstracted away in modern tools.

There might be some issues, though - especially in terms of limited debugging and features compared to most other IDEs. Beating those problems makes you think critically and gives you problem-solving abilities as well. 
You come to realize just how much technology has advanced and appreciate the origin of C++ programming roots that eventually led to the development of the highly advanced programming frameworks in use today.

Lance: 
My reflection on my experience is that it is fun and also kind of hard because i am still learning programming and it is a big help for me to learn more because of the experience i had and it can help me for other future activities so that i know what i am going to do
and it will become more easier and easier once i had a lot more experience coding things

Learning Turbo C++ can be an excellent experience because it would sharpen the foundational programming skills as well as provide you with a historical view of software development, 
so you are pretty well prepared to adapt to learning more modern tools and languages.
